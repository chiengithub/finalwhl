### A Guideline for Projector Beginner

Nowadays, the projectors are no longer used only for presentations or demonstrations, but also have become a multi-purpose home entertainment tool. The latest projectors can handle a wide variety of multimedia content—films, photos, documents, games, and many can play music as well. 

Whether you're gaming, working, or building your home theater, here's what to concern when choosing a home projector, along with our top pick.


 - #### Portability
 
 Home projectors do not have to be used at home. Many are portable enough to travel with, or at least to easily move from room to room. The gaming projectors we've seen are easy to bring along to a LAN party. Micro-projectors and slightly larger models are highly portable, come in both consumer and business models (many are good for both personal and business use).

 - #### Projection Technology
 
 There are two major types of video projectors: DLP (Digital Light Projection) and LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). 
 A DLP projector usually adopts a DMD (Digital Micro Mirror Device) as its image converter, which is an integrated circuit that provides a micro-mirror for each point of the image. Current DLP video projectors can process up to seven separate colors with color segments on the single wheel, providing smooth and jitter-free images with wider color gamut. 
 
 DLP technology processes many other advantages:
 - High speed
 - No gloss or deterioration on images
 - Higher contrast than an LCD projector
 - Almost no deterioration of the pixels
 - Less sensitive to dust because the optics are encapsulated
 
 On the other hand, LCD uses a beam of high-intensity light which travels through thousands of shifting pixels. Therefore, LCD projectors produce brighter pictures and usually cost less. However, LCD projectors can’t display true black tints well and the “dead pixels” problem cannot be completely avoided according to the limitation of LCD technology itself. Also, the lamps on LCD projectors tend to wear out after a few thousand hours of use.
 
 Notice that projectors with high-performance DLP are often used in cinemas. So, when looking for a projector for your home theater, you might want to choose a DLP projector.

  - #### Resolution
  
  Ideally, your projector's native resolution—the number of pixels in its display—should match the resolution of the content you'll most frequently be displaying. For videos and games, you'll want a widescreen native aspect ratio such as 16:9 or 16:10. Both home theater and home entertainment projectors are best with 1080p resolution. If you're a more demanding user, you should consider a 4K projector with a resolution of 3,840 by 2,160, twice as many vertical and horizontal pixels as 1080p. But there's currently a limited amount of content available that can take advantage of 4K resolution.
  
  - #### Brightness
  
  There is no best level for brightness, and brighter isn't always better. For a home theater projector used in a dark room, 1000 lumen can easily give you a large, bright image, while a 2000-lumen projector may be so bright that it's hard on the eyes. On the other hand, for a portable data projector used in well-lit locations, 2000 to 3000 lumens will be the right range. For large rooms, you may want something even brighter.
  
  The point is that the best level of brightness depends on the amount of ambient light, the size of the image, and even the material in the screen you're using. Also, keep in mind that perception of brightness is measured logarithmically; it takes a lot more than doubling the number of lumens for an image to appear twice as bright. Thus, modest differences in rated brightness (say, 2200 and 2500 lumens) are usually of little significance.
