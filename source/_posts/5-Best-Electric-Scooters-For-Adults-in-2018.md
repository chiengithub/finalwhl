You've probably been wondering why electric scooters are all around the streets. You would understand if you took a bus from the bus stop under your company to another one near you home and you had to take a 30-minute walk to finish the rest of the way. 

Electric scooters have been around the urban areas for a couple years. Initially, they were just used as entertainment and fun rides. Since people realized that they can solve the problem that is mentioned above, however, they have been taken seriously. Now, it’s very usual to see people commuting in their electric scooters on the streets or waiting for a metro with this little vehicle compacted at their side.

The electric scooters below provide a mix of great features that you need for a fun and convenient ride. Here are 5 best electric scooters for adults in 2018, you may choose the one that is suitable for you and your loved ones.

### Alllu VehiGo Quick Charge Smart Tricycle Scooter

The latest comes first. [VehiGo](https://www.alllu.com/vehigo/) is the world's first [electric tricycle scooter](https://www.alllu.com/) with quick charge feature. With 15mins charging, the power can be fully charged and support 20-25km riding. Riders only need to put a simple light plug wire in their pocket for charging instead of a big and heavy charger/convertor. Quick charge function is meant to solve the "long distance anxiety while driving". 

Safety must be first. VehiGo’s air craft level aluminum frame design provides strong and safe riding and with its 3-wheel design, you can stand on the feet plate without holding the handlebar and keep natural balance. Lean left or lean right, it just can't tumble.

Another highlight is its easy folding. By pressing and lifting the folding lock, VehiGo can be folded and stand on the ground and drag like luggage or put into a vehicle back trunk easily. And unlike the traditional e-bikes using spinning throttle, VehiGo uses brake lever to control the accelerating and speed control.


What’s more, VehiGo is equipped with a 360° limitless steering handlebar, which allows riders to drive forward and backwards easily for dealing with complicate traffic/road situation.


What impresses me most is its social function. Alllu realizes that it's essential to add some internet linking function to VehiGo to make it more than just a scooter or transport tools. With the social function, riders can say hello to the riders nearby and make friends by pressing a "hook-up button" on the handlebar. Contact info will be exchanged on the cell if the riders agree to accept the greeting.

Additionally, great features also include: 

Camera Recording: a 130MP wide angle lens camera is built in the handlebar and the video of riding will be automatically uploaded to your cell by pressing the "Record" button on the handlebar;

Smart APP Control System: it helps to locate your VehiGo with the built-in 4G module. The Anti-theft feature is always on to prevent your scooter from stealing. Set up an alarm warning with certain area, your VehiGo is safe and solid on the ground. Also, the Temp key can be submitted if you want to rent your VehiGo to your friend or run a rental business. 

Toothless Hub Motor and Silent Controller: the 36V 250W motor is able to supports up to 100kgs/220pounds and provide stable and comfortable riding experience.

Yes, I know, you find nothing about this amazing product on Amazon. Alllu is going to launch a crowd funding campaign for VehiGo on Kickstarter with a very competitive early bird price starting at $649 . To know more, check its campaign website.

### URB-E Folding Electric Scooter, Pro GT Black

To me, the first highlight of this product is its cool (or weird) appearance. The frame is built with aircraft grade aluminum and carbon fiber, which makes the whole product incredibly lightweight( it weighs only 16kg) and durable. With its foldable design, URB-E Pro GT’s earns some points in terms of portability and compactness, and its 36V lithium ion battery is able to provide a 32km range at the top speed of 18mph.

Additionally, if you want to do some customization for your scooter, there are some extra accessories that you can purchase, like a basket or a cup holder.

But there is a problem that needs to be mentioned: it is probably not affordable for everyone, as it is a bit expensive.

### Glion Dolly Foldable Lightweight Adult Electric Scooter

Children shouldn’t have all the fun. Glion Dolly, with its not-a-toy durable aircraft aluminum frame which has been specially treated to resist corrosion, is designed for daily use by commuters and adults.

It is powered by a 36v 6.6ah rechargeable lithium ion battery and a potent 250W brushless hub motor located in the rear wheel, which is able to provide enough boost to move the average adult at up to 24km an hour on a full charge. A smooth ride can be assured by its 8-inch tires featuring a honeycomb interior developed by the military, which guaranteed that they will never go flat. 

Controls are water resistant, convenient and quite straightforward, with a twist-grip accelerator on the right, an a twist-grip accelerator on the left. An easy-to-read handlebar-mounted battery indicator keeps track of battery life. The package of this electric scooter contains a pedestrian bell and a cover bag.

In terms of price, it is absolutely a affordable solution for outdoor recreation and portable transportation.
### Uscooters/E-Twow Electric Booster Scooter

Uscooter Booster Electric Scooter creates a fusion of the classic kick scooter with the convenience of an electric motor, innovative technologies and high-performance features.

Weighing only 11kg, this scooter is a versatile vehicle that features portability. The patented 3-point folding system slims the scooter down to a manageable size, 36 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 12 inches high. So you can just  carry it around like a trolley.

One of the highlights is its kinetic energy recover system (KERS technology), which reduces energy consumption and actually feeds the battery when braking. The double braking systems, which is effective at stopping the vehicle, include a hand brake that activates the magnetic motor brake and a foot brake that activates both the magnetic motor brake and a friction brake on the back wheel. And when the scooter’s battery is dead, you can still ride it like a kick scooter.

Thanks to its brushless DC motor, this e-scooter can reach a top speed of 18 mph and make a 33km ride with full charge. A LED display is also integrated for quickly checking information like battery and mileage.

Of course, good stuffs are never cheap. the price of this electric scooter is a bit on the higher end.

### Super Turbo 1000 Watt Elite 36V Electric Scooter
![](http://ehaidev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Allu-9.jpg)
Super Turbo 1000 Watt Elite features an impressive 1000W motor that is capable to carry up to a 113kg rider on flat paved terrain and up to 136kg with the optional hill kit accessory. It provides top speed of up to 26mph and a maximum ride distances of up to 28km per charge (4-6 hours to fully charge). Notably, it includes an innovative Econo/Turbo Mode Button: Econo Mode for Distance and Turbo Mode for Speed.

A nice feature is the turn key ignition system. This enhances security to prevent your scooter from thefts. And It also comes with some cool features, like a LED headlight for traveling at night, and the extra wide tires for providing a smooth and comfortable ride across a wide range of terrain.
But one shortage is that it is much heavier than smaller scooters.
